## Site features

The page features a consistent navbar, a responsive layout built with Bootstrap, and responsive images. It is fully responsive and leverages Bootstrap's grid system. The site also features a sticky footer on every page. The CSS only requires one media query to keep the lead-text in the header more narrow on larger screens for better readability.

### The homepage

The homepage serves as the about page and features a header with a headline and intro as well as a bio-part with a portrait as well as a short profile. There are also buttons to get to the portfolio page as well as the contact page and a dropdown menu features links to my online profiles. These links open in new tabs for the user's convenience.

### The portfolio page

The portfolio features a header with a short intro as well as a grid of six cards that each summarize a digital project I've done. They feature responsive images, a short description text, and a link to get to the respective website.

### The contact page

The contact page features a header with a short intro as well as a dummy-form to submit a message. The form constists of three fields to enter an email address, a name, and a message.
